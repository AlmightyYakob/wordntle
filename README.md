# Wordn'tle - A daily fake word game [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6a4e7cc3-f123-4bfc-8c45-47d222a1e146/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wordntle/deploys)

Wordn'tle is a variation of wordle that uses generated fake words instead of real words. These words are grammatically plausible english words, and aren't just a string of 5 random characters like `ikghj`. An example of a valid answer is `shamp`.

Based on Evan You's [vue-wordle](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle) Vue Wordle implementation.
